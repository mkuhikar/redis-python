# Overview
This repository contains a Python-based Redis server implementation that aims to replicate the functionality of the standard Redis server. It provides a foundation for understanding and experimenting with Redis concepts and architecture.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or later
pip for package installation
Installation
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/redis-python-server.git
```

Install dependencies:

```
cd redis-python-server
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Start the server:

```
python app/main.py
```

Connect to the server:
Use a Redis client library like redis-py to connect to the server. For example:

```
import redis

r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)
```

Perform Redis operations:
Use the Redis client to execute commands like SET, GET, LPUSH, LRANGE, etc. For example:

```
r.set('key', 'value')
value = r.get('key')
print(value)
```

### Key Features
1. Basic Redis commands: Implements core Redis commands for data structures like strings, lists, sets, hashes, and zsets.
2. Persistence: Supports persistence mechanisms like RDB and AOF for data durability.
3. Networking: Handles TCP connections and network communication.
4. Data structures: Implements the underlying data structures used in Redis.

### Limitations
1. Performance: May not match the performance of the official Redis server due to Python's overhead.
2. Feature completeness: Might not implement all advanced Redis features or optimizations.
3. Testing: Requires thorough testing to ensure correctness and reliability.
